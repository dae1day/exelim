# Rails Assignment | Two-sided Marketplace

## Problem and Solution
### Problem

#### Problem 1
Problems when buying second hand PC parts:
1. Quality Assurance - buying good or at least of acceptable quality parts.
2. Access - No central, dedicated, or trusted platform
3. Trust - Buyer and seller both having each others best interests in mind too. Difficulty establishing trust between parties.
    * Accountability - If something goes wrong, it can become messy.

There are good quality second hand parts available at "fair" and "affordable" prices, but due to the above issues, it is difficult in both selling and buying them. 

#### Problem 2
E-waste is becoming a growing problem.

By encouraging and enabling transactions for second hand pc parts, this can help reduce the problem.

### Solution

A twosided marketplace for second hand PC parts. 
1. Quality Assurance
    * Ratings and review system for each seller and buyer
    * Verification of users (e.g. verification icon)
2. Access
    * A twosided marketplace that will enable users to buy/sell PC parts 
3. Trust
    * Quality Assurance (point 1 - specific to the item)
    * Protection
        * Something like PayPal
        * E.g. Seller - ensures money follows through
        * E.g. Buyer - ensures refund if a problem occurs (where it is the fault of the seller)

## For the future
Future ideas:
* Sell prebuilt PCs 
* Custom PC building service
* Direct to consumer sale (both second hand parts and new)
* Services related to IT (e.g. support)
